	Alice: Madness Returns (Should review this at some point)
	-----------------------
	The tone of Madness Returns can be glimpsed in the image of Alice jumping off a platform and begins twisting in the air, 
	a flutter of butterflies surrounding her as she glides to the ground before whipping out her butcher knife and carving her way 
	through a mass of sentient inkblots.
	-> I'd love to create a story with flowery imagery and a dark undercurrent.
	-> Female protagonist? Maybe Juliet Stone
	
	Scarlett Reicer

	All that matters is victory. We can be the moral centres of the universe but it won't matter when we're dead.
	The actions we take tonight will be measured in terms of their success not their morality. This is life and death. 
	The important thing is whether we wake up tomorrow morning and the job is done.
	You want to know why the good guys always win? Because they're alive to write the textbooks.
