Description: 
	This file exists to store any ideas that I have for future writing projects and categories of projects
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Writing: Stores any short stories and creative ideas that I come up with and write.
	-> Write: From Heads Unworthy
	-> Write: Paper Walls (Keith Buchant and Skye Clarke)
	-> Write: Reicer (An conversation with Scarlett)
	-> Write: The World's Finest: Batgirl and Supergirl
	-> Write: A dangerous ambition 
				Possibly the tyranny of abstraction. The idea being that people do horrible things in the name of some perceived greater good.
				While the goal could be noble it is the actions taken to achieve that goal that issue should be taken with.
For now, this section of writing projects is being shut down as it is time-consuming and doesn't work towards a foreseeable goal. 
While I like writing fiction, it has become a distraction away from what is important. 
	
Design Documents: Any design documents that I create
	-> Champions of Olympus
	-> Redwing Chronicles: Arisen 2
		This is meant to be a continuation of the Terran Chronicles series. Arisen 2 is a reflection on Arisen 1 with a 
	-> Dynasty: Civil War (Brother, my brother)
		This is an idea that I came up with a while ago but Matthew stoked the fires of recently. 
		He wanted to create a war game where one played soldiers on both sides of the conflict to make a point about war being hell.
		Personally I would set this in the context of a Civil War (possibly the Cryan Civil War)
		This was initially meant to be a mechanics-based board game but I'd like to see what comes out of a collaboration with Matt.
		
This section should take the place of the creative-writing section. If I am going to spend time writing it should be about something that will
have foreseeable benefits and serves part of an overarching goal.  
	
Review: Reviews/ critiques that I have on properties that interest me.
	-> Darksiders 2
	-< Prince of Persia (2008)
	-> Resonance of Fate
	-> Alice: Madness Returns
	-> Remember Me
	-> El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron
	
	Alice: Madness Returns (Should review this at some point)
	-----------------------
	The tone of Madness Returns can be glimpsed in the image of Alice jumping off a platform and begins twisting in the air, 
	a flutter of butterflies surrounding her as she glides to the ground before whipping out her butcher knife and carving her way 
	through a mass of sentient inkblots.
	-> I'd love to create a story with flowery imagery and a dark undercurrent.
	-> Female protagonist? Maybe Juliet Stone
	
Editorials and Exercises: Any opinion pieces/ discursive essays that I write a particular subject. This is envisioned as being about gaming but it 
could extended to just about anything
		
	-> 	Write an essay discussing two contrasting systems of morality in games you have played. 
		What actions does each game reward and what actions does it punish? 
		Address the relationship of right behaviour in the game with right behaviour in the real world.
		Actions: Reread the chapter on Game Worlds then select 2 games with contrasting morality systems for this essay (1500 word limit)
		Deadline: 20 July 2015

	All that matters is victory. We can be the moral centres of the universe but it won't matter when we're dead.
	The actions we take tonight will be measured in terms of their success not their morality. This is life and death. 
	The important thing is whether we wake up tomorrow morning and the job is done.
	You want to know why the good guys always win? Because they're alive to write the textbooks.
