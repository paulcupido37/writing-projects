This repository exists to store any writing projects that I start.
The vision is for it to store reviews, creative writing, opinion pieces, editorials, design documents, initial thoughts and any other category that I come up with.

Each category will have its own folder and each folder will contain work that I have done. 
The 'master' branch will be for works that are complete. 
The 'in progress' branch will be for works that I am still working on.
The 'ideas' branch will be for ideas for new documents and projects to work on.
	ideas must never be merged with master. 
	in progress will eventually be merged with master.
